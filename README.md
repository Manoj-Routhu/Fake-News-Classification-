<h1 align="center"> Fake News Classification </h>

<h4>How much of what we read on social media and on supposedly “credible” news sites is trustworthy? It is extremely easy for anyone to post what they desire and although that can be acceptable, there is the notion of taking it a step too far, such as posting false information online in order to cause a panic, using lies to manipulate another person’s decision, or essentially anything else that can have lasting repercussions. There is so much information online that it is becoming impossible to decipher the true from the false. Thus, this leads to the problem of fake news.</p>

1. Gathering your relevant Fakenews dataset.
